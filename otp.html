    <h2>What is an OTP?</h2>
    <p>
        OTP (One Time Password) is a temporary numeric or alphanumeric code
        used to verify user identity during online transactions or logins.
    </p>

    <h2>How OTP is Generated</h2>
    <p>
        OTPs are generated using secure algorithms that depend on time,
        counters, or random number generators.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Server generates OTP</li>
        <li>OTP is linked to user session</li>
        <li>Sent via SMS, email, or authenticator app</li>
        <li>Expires after a short time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why OTP is Important</h2>
    <p>
        OTP adds an extra layer of security and protects users from
        unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.
